Album Art Search

Comment (Required): This is the landing page with HTML and CSS elements
served to clients that connect to localhost:3000 root.

Other than addding a background to add some texture to the body and adding metadata for the viewport
in order to better view and test the site on my cellphone, I did not make any major changes to provided code.

When the homepage is loaded, the user has the choice to enter an artist name, or any term at all, and hit the search button
to look for album art relevant to term typed in. Upon hitting search, the term in the input 
box is sent to page "search" through GET as determined by the form action and method, while the information entered is stored
under "artist" as determined by the input box name. Hence, some query for "Papas da Lingua" would be formatted as /search?artist=Papas+da+Lingua

After knowing that the Spotify APY responds to queries in form q= ... and not artist= ... we could
avoid parsing later by changing the name of the input box to "q" instead of "artist". This way the query
sent to search would be closer to the query accepted by Sotify, but this is just a detail that I 
noticed and decided to comment on. As result, the previous example would become /search?q=Papas+da+Lingua
